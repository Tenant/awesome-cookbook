# Intro

## Citroen

This vehicle is equipped with four Laser-scan sensors, three in front of the vehicle, and one back the vehicle.

The surrounding objects will reflect the laser and by calculating the time difference between ejecting and receiving lasers, we can figure out whether there are objects around vehicle and where the objects is. 

This program visualizes the calculation results. The orange yellow car represent our vehicle, red points represent pedestrians, and green lines represent the walls of surrounding buildings.

Using these insight, we can make the vehicle understand its surrounding environment and further more, we can try to design driving strategy to achieve driverless driving.

## Jeep

This vehicle is equipped with one panoramic camera and one Velodyne Laser-scan camera. The panoramic camera is just like common cameras, but it can capture all the images around vehicle. The Velodyne Laser-scanner eject laser beams and calculate the time difference between ejecting and receiving lasers, the figure out whether there are objects around vehicle and where the object is.

This program visualize the Panoramic camera data, and this one visualize the laser data.
